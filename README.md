# Parallelizing-Bioinformatics-Program-for-Optimal-Performance
CAB401 Assignment 1.  This bionformatics program approximates bacteria through complex algorithms and loops. It was first analysed and then multiple parallelization tools were used to drastically lower both its compilation and run time. It was then run on a 64 core machine through AWS to determine speedup
